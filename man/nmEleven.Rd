\title{Item Model 11}
\usage{
nmEleven(items, logic = "one", n = 2, arith = "add")
}
\arguments{
\item{items}{Generate a random mix of items.}

\item{logic}{The combination of sequences follow two logic.}

\item{n}{The value that the arithmetic operator uses to calculate the next value}

\item{arith}{The arithmetic operator of your choice ("add","substr","multi","div").}
}
\description{
This function creates number series that is a combination of Arithmetic + Linear + Progressive coefficient. The minimum number of items that will be generated is 2.
}
\details{
# Arithmetic + Linear + Progressive coefficient
First logic is combining sequences x y x y x y x y = one simple, one progressive.
Second logic is combining sequences x y x y x y x y = two progressive.
